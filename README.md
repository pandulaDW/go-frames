# Go-Frames is a clone for the python pandas library written in Go

Go-Frames is an ongoing project to build a clone for the python pandas library in Go. This
requires an abstract data structure, that is equivalent to Pandas dataframes and a vast collection
of methods that goes along with it. Project is planned to be extended for machine learning as well
by closely following the Sklearn library in Python which would be compliment to the Go-Frames library.
The goal of the project is to get python data scientists to quickly migrate their code bases to
Go for improved performances.
